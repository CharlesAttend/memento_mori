# Memento Mori

## Overview

Memento Mori is a life calendar project inspired by [this concept](https://memento-mori-calendar.netlify.app/calendar). The goal is to provide a visual representation of one's life in weeks, helping users reflect on time and priorities.

## Features (Planned)

- **Personalized Life Calendar:** View your life in weeks, based on your birth date and expected lifespan.
- **Comparison Mode:** Compare your life chart with someone else's (e.g., a friend, family member, historical figure).
- **Meeting Frequency Estimator:** Visualize how many times you will see a person again if you meet them at a fixed frequency (e.g., once a month).
- **Customization:** Support for different visual styles, themes, and data inputs.
- **Export & Share:** Save and share your life calendar as an image or interactive link.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with \`npm install\` (or \`pnpm install\` or \`yarn\`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter]\([https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters)) for your target environment.
